# CRUD-database

This is database app that I made using PHP and MySQL. It is a CRUP application which allow user to create, read, update, and delete.
In this app allow admin to add user, look up user, update user info, and delete user.

Users can use the database to query for food information. Those infomation include nutritional values of the food, method of stroge,
and which seansons is best for the food item. 

The database manager would update the contents of the database such as food items, costs, type of storage, and nutritional values. 
The database manager can also update information pertaining to users, such as their name, health issues, height and weight.


#The entity sets for the database are:
#● User
#● Food
#● Vitamins
#● Minerals
#● Macronutrients
#● Amino Acids

The operations that can be performed on the database for maintenance are:
● Enter the amount of vitamins/minerals/amino acids/macronutrients a food item has.
● Enter new entries for food items that were not in the database.
● Change the amount of vitamins/minerals/amino acids/macronutrients (if needed).
● Update client’s health issue, name, weight, height (if needed).
● Change the cost of the food.
